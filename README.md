This is Food Finder, the app to find food recipes powered by edamam API (just the free basic version of their license, which has a max of 10 requests per minute, so be patient when searching for food. (https://developer.edamam.com/)

You can download this code to learn or play with it. Nothing crazy going on, some API connecions, @GET requests and possibly google requests.
If you want to download the preview 0.1 APK version, go to http://www.mediafire.com/file/hohah4yz695k55h/FoodFinder.apk/file

On a future note, I plan to add a "favorites" tab so that you can keep all your favorite recipes at one place.
Feel free to mail me at azurecodingexperience@gmail.com if you have any questions about it or you need support with your account data.

That's all, Code clean and never force push!
