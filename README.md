This is Food Finder, the app to find food recipes powered by edamam API (just the free basic version of their license 
(https://developer.edamam.com/)

You can download this code to learn or play with it.
Nothing crazy going on, some API connecions, @GET requests and possibly google requests.
Feel free to mail me at azurecodingexperience@gmail.com if you have any questions about it.

A download link for the APK will be provided in the future with a stable version of the app, hopefully with a log in module implemented.

That's all, 
Code clean and never force push!
